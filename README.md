First you unzip and you attempt setup.

If setup doesn’t work you go into “Application Files”
Then go into “THEGREATCODEKING_1_0_0_27”
Then click “THEGREATCODEKING.exe” the one that is the exe is the one you hit. If you don’t see the .exe at the end of the filename THEGREATCODEKING then it’s the one with the drawing next to it. That is the one you hit.

If the program doesn’t run from you hitting the ‘“THEGREATCODEKING.exe” you must install

Direct x 9 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34429
Even if you have newer direct x install older direct x to get this game to run

The xna redistributable https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20914
Install this and the game will run

After installing those two things you can click the exe and the game will work.
I hope that helps you run the game
Sorry for having so many prerequisites to getting the game running.
